This is a near-complete scaffold. To fully run:
- Run composer install locally in this project
- Add APP_KEY via php artisan key:generate
- Ensure DB credentials in .env are correct
- Register or use seeded users (admin@example.com/password)
- To enable Google OAuth, require laravel/socialite and implement callbacks in AuthController
- If you want me to also add Seeder for sample addresses and more products, tell me.
